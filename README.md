Here's a **very basic and simple README (in plain text)** appropriate for your current project:

---

**Module 2 Assignment â€“ Coursera**

This is a basic responsive webpage made for the Module 2 assignment of the Coursera course *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers*.

The project includes:

* One HTML file (`index.html`)

It shows a heading and three sections: **Chicken**, **Beef**, and **Sushi**.
The layout changes based on screen size (desktop, tablet, mobile) using media queries.

No frameworks were used. Only plain HTML and CSS.

To view the page, just open `index.html` in a browser.

Let me know if you want it saved in a `README.txt` file inside your folder.
